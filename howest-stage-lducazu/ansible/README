= Ansible

Configuration management tool to configure and update the GCP virtual machines.

There are 2 virtual machines, one that runs a local PostGreSQL database instance (`irefbuild`)
and another one to administer the Google cloud managed PostGreSQL instance (`irefaccess`).

To configure the machines

  $ ansible-playbook irefbuild.yaml
  $ ansible-playbook irefaccess.yaml

== irefbuild

VM `irefbuild` needs both the data disk (`dataext`) and the database disk (`pgdbdisk`).
These disks are created as part of the Terraform configuration scripts. Unless the disks are created from a snapshot,
there won't be a file system initialized on these devices.

Before running the playbook, you need to `ssh` to the machine and execute

  # mkfs -t xfs /dev/disk/by-id/google-dataext
  # mkfs -t xfs /dev/disk/by-id/google-pgdbdisk

== irefaccess

To access the data disk on machine `irefaccess`

. Make sure the disk is not read-write mounted on `irefbuild`
. Uncomment the `attached_disk` snippet in `terraform/gce-vms/irefaccess.tf`
. Uncomment the `Mount data disk` snippet in `ansible/irefaccess.yaml`
