== Protein-protein interaction databases

* Molecular & protein-protein interaction data is a key resource in biomedical research
* Different research groups explore different dimensions: biological processes, species...
* Overlapping datasets, each using their own format & identifiers
* DIP was the first (2002)

== HUPO PSI-MI

* In 2004 the Human Proteome Organization publishes the first Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions
  standard
** XML based
** focused on PPI
* In 2007, publication of PSI-MI 2.5 standard
** More general molecular interactions
** XML and tabular format (_PSI-MITAB_)

== Interaction partner identifiers

* Different PPI sources use different identifiers
** BioGRID: gene identifiers
** IntAct: uniprot accessions
** BIND: RefSeq identifiers
* Aggregating data over multiple databases is a challenge

[%notitle]
== Complex

image::images/complex.png[]

* 7 protein units -> 21 possible binary interactions
* 12 confirmed (solid lines):
** spread across 4 databases
** 2 unique to HPRD (thick black lines)
** 5 unique to OPHID (thick grey lines)

== The Big Picture

image::images/rog-rig.svg[]

* Interaction partner identifiers -> mapped to Redundant Object Group (ROG)
* Groups of ROGID -> mapped to Redundant Interaction Group identifier (RIG)

== SEGUID & ROGID

* Sequence Globally Unique Identifier
** Primary AA sequence: converted to upper case, all non-sequence characters are discarded
** SHA-1 digest of this string -> 160-bit number
** Base-64 encoded, remove final padding (=) -> 27 char
* Redundant Object Group Identifier
** Concatenation of SEGUID & NCBI taxonomy identifier

== RIGID

* Compose a list of the ROGID of each interaction partner
** binary heteromeric interaction: 2 distinct ROGIDs
** homodimer: 2 x the same ROGID
** complex: possibly long list of ROGIDs
* Sort the list alphabetically
* Concatenate to a single string
* SHA-1 digest
* Base-64 encoded, remove final padding

== Enter the iRefIndex

* the _interaction reference index_ is a unifying, consolidated, non-redundant database
* combining several other PPI databases (25)
* maintained by the VIB Bioinformatics Core group (https://irefindex.vib.be/)
* updates released by HoWest students:
** Release 18 by Tom Nissens (2021)
** Release 19 by yours truly (2022)
