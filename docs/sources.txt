Parsing and Interpretation Issues for PSI-MI XML Sources
--------------------------------------------------------

Some BIND Translation files lack a suitable encoding declaration:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

Without such a declaration, a UTF-8 encoding is expected, but the 10090 and
9606 taxonomy files actually employ byte values that apparently represent
characters encoded using ISO-8859-1, and the resulting byte sequences are not
valid UTF-8 content.

Generally, identifier locality restrictions are not prominently specified or
adhered to.

  * For version 1.0, the xs:ID type is used for id attributes, but sources
    like OPHID repeat values of such attributes.

  * For version 2.5, the xs:int type is used for id attributes, and it is
    noted that these refer to distinct entities throughout a file. However,
    participant identifiers are effectively local and may not have any meaning
    at all.

MIPS and OPHID use version 1.0 of the specification and need to provide values
using different elements, although these elements correspond directly to
elements in version 2.5.

OPHID provides multiple entry elements in the same file, thus making things like
experiment references local to a particular entry.

OPHID refers to the same experiment more than once in some interactions.

DIP and other sources use participant identifiers which are local to each
interaction.

InnateDB reuses participant identifiers even within the same interaction, and
also reuses interactor identifiers within the same interaction, even when the
interactors are different! Moreover, InnateDB maintains a separate interactor
list but does not reference those interactors.

HPRD occasionally misuses reference attributes such as in the following
example (from data/HPRD/PSIMI_XML/08855_psimi.xml):

  <secondaryRef db="uniprot" dbAc="MI:0486" id="Q0VAR9,Q96CW7"/>

Parsing and Interpretation Issues for MITAB Sources
---------------------------------------------------

MPIDB sources employ a MITAB variant which exposes experimental details in a
non-standard way. This can result in interactions being assigned multiple
interaction types, which is typically not done by XML-based sources even
though the schema does permit it.
