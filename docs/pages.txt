Building the Documentation for MoinMoin
---------------------------------------

The pages directory contains documents ready for deployment in a MoinMoin wiki
instance. Such an instance can be set up as follows.

Obtain MoinMoin and moinsetup
-----------------------------

The MoinMoin downloads page provides source archives for the software:

http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinDownload

The source archives are easier to use than a repository version, but both can
be used with moinsetup.

To more easily install MoinMoin and extensions, the moinsetup program can be
used:

http://moinmo.in/ScriptMarket/moinsetup

Unpack MoinMoin
---------------

The source archive for MoinMoin can be unpacked as follows (using the 1.9.7
release as an example):

tar zxf moin-1.9.7.tar.gz

Configure the Wiki
------------------

The moinsetup distribution provides example configuration files. However, the
following would be suitable for the given MoinMoin version:

[installation]
moin_distribution = moin-1.9.7
prefix            = moin
web_app_dir       = webapps
web_site_dir      = sites-available

[site]
common_dir        = irwiki
url_path          = /irwiki
superuser         = AdminUser
site_name         = iRefIndex Wiki
front_page_name   = FrontPage
theme_default     = modernized

Here, the MoinMoin libraries will be installed under 'moin' with the CGI
script placed inside 'webapps' and Apache site definitions placed inside
'sites-available'. The wiki itself will reside inside the 'irwiki' directory.
This configuration can be saved as moinsetup.cfg so that moinsetup will find
it by default.

Set Up the Wiki
---------------

To install MoinMoin and the wiki resources in the specified locations, use the
following command:

python moinsetup.py -m setup

There are also ways of performing specific tasks: run moinsetup.py without any
options to see the help text.

Various questions will be asked by moinsetup, and the program will describe
various additional measures needed to make the wiki available to the Web
server:

  * Since the 'sites-available' directory is probably not one used by any
    installed Web server (you can specify such a directory instead), it will
    be necessary to copy the site definition from there to a suitable location
    and then tell the Web server to enable the wiki site.

  * The permissions of the wiki resources will need changing to be accessible
    to the Web server. One of the scripts whose names are shown on the display
    by moinsetup may be run to achieve this.

See the moinsetup documentation for more information about this process.

Install Additional Extensions
-----------------------------

The documentation pages need the ImprovedTableParser extension for MoinMoin:

http://moinmo.in/ParserMarket/ImprovedTableParser

A repository version can be obtained or a source archive can be downloaded and
unpacked.

The extension may then be installed as follows:

python moinsetup.py -m install_extension_package ImprovedTableParser
python moinsetup.py -m install_parsers ImprovedTableParser/parsers
python moinsetup.py -m install_theme_resources ImprovedTableParser
python moinsetup.py -m edit_theme_stylesheet screen.css improvedtableparser.css
python moinsetup.py -m edit_theme_stylesheet print.css improvedtableparser.css

For graphs, the GraphvizParser extension is also required:

http://moinmo.in/ParserMarket/graphviz

This may be installed as follows:

python moinsetup.py -m install_parsers GraphvizParser/parsers

A general requirement is the MoinSupport extension:

http://hgweb.boddie.org.uk/MoinSupport

This extension may then be installed as follows:

python moinsetup.py -m install_extension_package MoinSupport

Make and Install a Package of the Documentation Pages
-----------------------------------------------------

In the 'irdata' directory, a page package can be built from the documentation
pages as follows:

python moinsetup.py -m make_page_package docs/pages page_package.zip

This package can be installed in the wiki as follows:

python moinsetup.py -m install_page_package page_package.zip

It may be the case that the above command needs elevated privileges, typically
because the Web server may have created files that need to be edited in the
installation process. If in doubt, use sudo or su to run the above command.

Viewing the Installed Pages
---------------------------

Assuming that the wiki is being served by the Web server, visiting the site
will probably yield a plain-looking front page and none of the usual pages
being available. This can be resolved as follows:

  * Log in as the superuser (whose name was given above).

  * Visit the LanguageSetup page (which you will do by entering it in the
    browser location bar as part of the URL); for example:

    http://localhost/irwiki/LanguageSetup

  * Under "Installing page packages", select the link "install help and system
    page packages".

  * Choose to "install" the "all_pages" package (for simplicity).

It should now be possible to inspect the RecentChanges page of the wiki and
see the iRefIndex documentation pages. If the list shows pages that are
missing or inaccessible, you may need to run the command given above to reset
the file permissions of wiki resources.
