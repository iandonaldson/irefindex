= Data Source Formats and Issues =

Although standard data formats exist for interaction data, there remain issues
with their application to the data provided by interaction databases, either
due to obvious non-compliance with the standards or due to ambiguity or a lack
of clarity or specificity in such standards. As a result, software that must
consume such data must be aware of issues that appear to defy common
assumptions about XML documents and schema design practices.

== Concepts and Relationships ==

Interaction data is centred upon the following general concepts: interactions,
interactors, participants and experiments. However, one may refer to an
interaction as a general statement (proteins A and B are known to interact)
without any contextual information, or as a specific observation (proteins A
and B interact are observed to interact) where certain conditions exist. Thus,
it becomes necessary to distinguish between two notions when referring to
concepts:

{{{#!table
'''Concept''' || '''Observations'''
              || '''Knowledge'''
==
Interaction   || Observed interactions (or interaction instances)
              || General interactions (or interaction knowledge)
==
Interactor    || Observed interactors (or specific experiment details of an interactor)
              || General interactors (or knowledge about the properties of a protein)
}}}

Particularly with interactions, it can be informative to consider a combination
of an interaction with an experiment when considering interaction data sources
and the interaction records that they provide.

Due to the flexibility of the data representation and presumably the nature of
collected information, some sources connect the fundamental concepts of
interaction data in different ways:

{{{#!table
.. Experiments grouped by interaction (many experiments per interaction)
|| !BioGrid, !IntAct, MINT, MPACT
==
.. Interactions grouped by experiment (many interactions per experiment)
|| BIND Translation, CORUM, DIP, HPRD, MPI-IMEX, MPI-LIT, OPHID
}}}

== References and Locality ==

Subject to various limitations, as described below, interaction data typically
employs identifiers that can be used to refer to specific entities. Inspection
of such data has led to the identification of the following hierarchy that can
be used to unambiguously refer to a particular entity in the source data:

  1. Data `source`
  2. Specific `filename`
  3. PSI-XML `entry` element
  4. Entity type or `scope`
  5. Identifier or `parentid`

Within the context of a particular entity type - for example, an interactor -
the hierarchy is simplified slightly as follows:

  1. Data `source`
  2. Specific `filename`
  3. PSI-XML `entry` element
  4. Interaction identifier or `interactorid`

Although it is technically possible to ensure that unique identifiers are
given to entities of their particular type in a particular source file, this
is not typically done by the source databases for all entity types. Thus, it
can be said that some identifiers have a particular "locality", meaning that
they can only be assumed to be unique within a particular region of a file or
within a certain scope.

For example, interactors in an interaction may be given the identifiers 1, 2
and 3, but the assignment of these identifiers to entities may only be valid
within that interaction. Within another interaction, the identifiers 1, 2 and
3 may refer to other entities. Fortunately, such chaotic numbering usually
occurs only when the identifiers have no actual use and where the entities'
involvement is ''implicit'', derived from the location of the elements
describing them in the data file. Where the involvement of entities in
relationships is ''explicit'', their identifiers typically have `entry`-level
locality and can be regarded as meaningful.

Thus, the following policies are used:

{{{#!table
'''Entity''' || '''Policy'''
==
Experiment   || Retain identifiers
==
Interaction  || Retain identifiers
==
Interactor   || Retain explicit interactor identifiers;
             .. assign unique identifiers for implicit interactors
==
Participant  || Assign unique identifiers
}}}

The consequence of such policies is that identifying an interactor within the
source data can be more involved using the identifier hierarchy described
above if meaningful identifiers are not present in the source data for
interactors. However, in conjunction with interaction information, the task of
identification should be simplified somewhat because interaction identifiers
should always be unique within any given `entry` element.

== Parsing and Interpretation Issues for PSI-MI XML Sources ==

Some BIND Translation files lack a suitable encoding declaration:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
}}}

Without such a declaration, a UTF-8 encoding is expected, but the 10090 and
9606 taxonomy files actually employ byte values that apparently represent
characters encoded using ISO-8859-1, and the resulting byte sequences are not
valid UTF-8 content.

Generally, identifier locality restrictions are not prominently specified or
adhered to.

  * For version 1.0, the `xs:ID` type is used for `id` attributes, but sources
  like OPHID repeat values of such attributes.

  * For version 2.5, the `xs:int` type is used for `id` attributes, and it is
  noted that these refer to distinct entities throughout a file. However,
  participant identifiers are effectively local and may not have any meaning
  at all.

MIPS and OPHID use version 1.0 of the specification and need to provide values
using different elements, although these elements correspond directly to
elements in version 2.5.

OPHID provides multiple entry elements in the same file, thus making things like
experiment references local to a particular entry.

OPHID refers to the same experiment more than once in some interactions.

DIP and other sources use participant identifiers which are local to each
interaction.

InnateDB reuses participant identifiers even within the same interaction, and
also reuses interactor identifiers within the same interaction, even when the
interactors are different! Moreover, InnateDB maintains a separate interactor
list but does not reference those interactors.

HPRD occasionally misuses reference attributes such as in the following
example (from `data/HPRD/PSIMI_XML/08855_psimi.xml`):

{{{
<secondaryRef db="uniprot" dbAc="MI:0486" id="Q0VAR9,Q96CW7"/>
}}}

== Parsing and Interpretation Issues for MITAB Sources ==

MPIDB sources employ a MITAB variant which exposes experimental details in a
non-standard way. This can result in interactions being assigned multiple
interaction types, which is typically not done by XML-based sources even
though the schema does permit it.
