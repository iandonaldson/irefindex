= Installation Details =

Once installed, the irdata distribution makes use of a number of directories
residing under an installation "prefix": a filesystem location acting as the
uppermost level of a system. For most programs on a system such a prefix would
be defined as `/` or the system root directory, but you can choose another
prefix (for example, `/home/irefindex`) as the location within which the
installed programs, resources and the relevant data will reside.

The table below summarises the directories employed by an installed system
relative to the installation prefix.

{{{#!table
'''Directory'''     || '''Purpose/Content'''
==
`/usr/bin`          || Programs and scripts from the `scripts` and `tools`
                    .. directories
==
`/usr/libNN/pythonX.Y/site-packages` || Python library files, where `NN` is an
                    .. optional suffix such as `64` on some 64-bit systems, and
                    .. where `X.Y` is a Python version number corresponding to
                    .. the installed version of Python
==
`/usr/share/irdata` || Files from the `manifests`, `resources`, `reports` and
                    .. `sql` directories
==
`/var/lib/irdata`   || The location of the downloaded and processed data
}}}

More specific details of the installed programs and resources can be found in
the `setup.py` script.
