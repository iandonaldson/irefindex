= Database Schema Details for iRefIndex =

The following principal table types are provided in the database schema:

{{{#!table
'''Prefix''' || '''Role'''
==
mitab        || MITAB-originating source data
==
xml          || PSI-XML-originating source data together with converted MITAB
             .. data
==
xml_xref     || Data specifically providing cross-references such as identifiers
==
xml_names    || Data specifically providing name information such as short
             .. labels and full names
==
irefindex    || Information derived from the common XML schema and sequence
             .. databases for the build process
}}}

In addition, the following source-related table types are used:

{{{#!table
'''Prefix''' || '''Source details'''               || '''Destination'''
==
bind         || BIND (flat text format)            || xml, xml_xref, xml_names
==

==

==

==

==
yeast        || Yeast                              || irefindex_sequences
}}}

The above data sources are typically delivered in non-XML and generally
unstandardised formats, meaning that their data must be processed before being
merged with other data. Only BIND tables contribute to the sum of interaction
data in the system.

== iRefIndex Table Reference ==

The [[Workflow|workflow]] documentation describes the population of tables,
and the following reference indicates where specific kinds of information can
be found.
